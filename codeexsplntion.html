<h2> pysical clock timer code </h2>
<p> 
The code of this project helps the clock timer run, the clock timer is not necessary for those who have another timer. it runs for fifteen minutes and at the mid-way point call about a teacher function as (explained in the rules) then coninues onwards. the code relys upon a plethera of function that are called in ocordance with a fifteen part loop.

if clock timer is missing, a cell phone stop watch can be used.

    <p>below are a few examples of sample code from the peer pressure card games servo components</p>  
    <pre>
 <kbd>

1:
def stepped_motion():
    my_angle = 0 
    for count in range(15):
2:
 my_angle = my_angle + 12
        crickit.servo_1.angle = my_angle
        time.sleep(60)
3:
  if my_angle = 96
           call teacher_sound
 </kbd>
    </pre>
    <p>
  1.  The function of this code is to set the amount of ticks that the servo clock will 
   execute, this is very important because without it the timer would only move 12 degrees. When the
   code says 'in range(15) it is telling the servo to execute the code 15 times. All of this code 
   is activated by a press of the servos A button.
    </p>
    <p>
  2. While the stepped motion function is running(mentioned above, it is the block that works in range 15) the angles of a
     motor attached to to the servos Every 1 min the clock timers servo arm angles rotates by 12 degrees, this is so that 
        after 15 executions of the code the final angle is equal to 180
