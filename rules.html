 <h3>Roles And Rank Mechanics</h3>
 <p>
Role cards determine the acceptability and influence of other players following how their role cards interact, the characters and their roles in detention include
</p>
 <p>
-Jock: Skipping too much class
</p>
 <p>
-Popular girl: On her phone in class
</p>
 <p>
-Cool kid: Sleeping in Class
</p>
 <p>
-Nerd: helping grade
</p>
 <p>
-Weird kid: Plagiarized on essay 
</p>
 <p>
-Teacher: supervises student
 </p>

 <p>
-Each role card has different influences on the others as indicated on the card.
These influences affect the ranking of the players in the game
Once a player convinces another player to commit an action, their ranking increases by their
influence on the influenced player’s role, and the influenced player's rank decreases by 
half of their influence over the influencers.
 </p>
 <h3>Teacher</h3>

 In the middle of the games 15 min period, a Sound is released from the clock, once this 
 sound is played, the person with the teacher cards needs to identify anyone talking at the
 time of the event (maybe half their ranks,idk)
