    <p><span style="color:#5271FF;">Action Cards:</span>You must convince another player to perform the action listed on the card. There are restrictions on what you can say/do when convincing them. All of these cards are blue. 
    </p>
    
   <p><span style="color:#FF3030">Speaking Cards:</span> You must convince another player to say items in the category listed on the card.
