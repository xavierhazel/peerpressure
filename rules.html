      <p>Statement of Game
In this game, you and your friends are a group of stereotypical kids deciding to play a game in detention. 
This game will be based on getting pressured or pressuring your friends; This game can lead to an ongoing 
rivalry and alliances between the students throughout the game (this is not an in-game function, but may be
the result of human interaction).This game brings social influences to the surface through surface-level
action and silent machinations
 </p>
 <h2>game rules</h2>
 <p>
Game pieces:
1 action cards
2 character cards
3 servo clock timer
 </p>
 <h2>game rules</h2>
 <p>
primary mechanics
Within rounds, players have to convince other players to commit an action in 15 minutes. Activities are found on action cards:
  
-action cards, including actions such as speaking, jumping, dancing, walking etc. in addition to the thing that must be convinced of the action, 
There are restrictions on things you can't say or do when convincing them, along with rings that they must avoid when convinced.
 </p>

 <p> 
-Rank is the means of awarding or removing points for players based on performance

 </p>
 <h2>Roles And rank Mechanics</h2>
 <p>
Roles And rank Mechanics
Role cards determine the acceptability and influence of other players following how their role cards interact, the characters and their roles in detention include
-Jock- Skipping too much class
-Popular girl- On her phone in class
-Cool kid- Sleeping in Class
-Nerd- helping grade
-Weird kid- Plagiarized on essay 
-Teacher- supervises student
 </p>

 <p>
-Each role card has different influences on the others as indicated on the card.
These influences affect the ranking of the players in the game
Once a player convinces another player to commit an action, their ranking increases by their
influence on the influenced player’s role, and the influenced player's rank decreases by 
half of their influence over the influencers.

Teacher
 In the middle of the games 15 min period, a Sound is released from the clock, once this 
 sound is played, the person with the teacher cards needs to identify anyone talking at the
 time of the event (maybe half their ranks,idk)


Before the start of the game
At the beginning of the game, each player picks a character card, not showing it to any other players.
Average Gameplay round action order
 All players receive their action card (never showing it to anyone)and decide on a person they try to convince 
 Players start the timer and begin convincing
Teacher event triggers
 People do or don't do their action
Rank changes are calculated (at this point character cards are revealed)
Victory condition 
 The player’s rank is equal to or exceeds 24

      <h2>pysical clock timer code</h>
    <p>below are a few examples of sample code from the peer pressure card games servo components</p>
    
    <pre>
 <kbd>

1:
def stepped_motion():
    my_angle = 0 
    for count in range(15):
 2:
 my_angle = my_angle + 12
        crickit.servo_1.angle = my_angle
        time.sleep(60)
 3:
  if my_angle = 96
           call teacher_sound
 </kbd>
    </pre>
    <p>
  1.  The function of this code is to set the amount of ticks that the servo clock will 
   execute, this is very important because without it the timer would only move 12 degrees. When the
   code says 'in range(15) it is telling the servo to execute the code 15 times. All of this code 
   is activated by a press of the servos A button.
  2. While the stepped motion function is running(mentioned above, it is the block that works in range 15) the angles of a
     motor attached to to the servos Every 1 min the clock timers servo arm angles rotates by 12 degrees, this is so that 
        after 15 executions of the code the final angle is equal to 180
  3. needs to be finished(not by me)
